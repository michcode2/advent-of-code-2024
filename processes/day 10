find a point 0
give it a trailhead id
go around each of the cardinal directions
if there is 1, add to a queue of things to check, along with the trailhead id 
go over the whole board once to find the trailheads
go over the queue and look for the next number, if its there add it to the queue
if there is a 9, add one to the trailhead counter

when a field is found, find the max and min in each axis to define a bounding box
find the area of the bounding box and subtract it from the known area to get the number of other crops
find the perimeter of the bounding box
the bounding box is now the mesh
go over each crop in the mesh, if it is the wrong type then 
    find the number of neighbours in the mesh, the perimeter goes up by that much
